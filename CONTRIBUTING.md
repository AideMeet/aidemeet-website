# Contributing to AideMeet

We welcome contributions! To keep things legally simple, we use the **Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)**.

## Developer Certificate of Origin

By contributing to this project, you certify that you have the right to submit the work and agree to the terms of the DCO 1.1. 

### How to sign your work
We require all commits to be signed off. This is done by adding a `Signed-off-by` line to every commit message.

**The easy way:**
Use the `-s` flag when committing:
```bash
git commit -s -m "Your descriptive commit message"
```

### Workflow
1. **Never push directly to `main`**. All changes must go through a Pull Request (PR).
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`.
3. Commit with a sign-off: `git commit -s -m "Your message"`.
4. Push to your branch and open a PR.

**Note:** Direct pushes to `main` trigger a security alert to the team.
